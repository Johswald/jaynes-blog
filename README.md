# Jaynes Blog
A blog for the reading club on Jaynes' Probability Theory

## Adding a chapter summary
Content files for the individual chapters are contained in `/docs/`. Simply copy the `*.md` file of a previous chapter and edit it. Once you are done with your changes, pushing the markdown file will automatically deploy it to the blog.
